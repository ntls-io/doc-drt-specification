# Schema

In the informal sense, the *data schema* is simply the particular structuring of
a given data set and the underlying (data) types involved.  In order to maximize
interoperability all implementations MUST implement schema in the sense
described by the
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html)
formal specification.

Take note, however, that this aforementioned specification is a **work in
progress** and is thus subject to abrupt and unexpected change.  At the time of
writing, this is part of the due course for technologies and specifcations in
areas related to this document.

Compliant implementations MAY allow additional formal schemas but this is not
REQUIRED by this version of the specification.  Note that, in future, additional
schemas might be added or removed to any requirement classification, in the sense
of the requirement language.
