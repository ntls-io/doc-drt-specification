# Schema

In the informal sense, the *data schema* is simply the particular structuring of
a given data set and the underlying (data) types involved.  In order to maximize
interoperability all implementations MUST implement schema in the sense
described by the
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html)
formal specification.

Compliant implementations MAY allow additional formal schemas but this is not
REQUIRED by this version of the specification.  Note that, in future, additional
schemas might be added or removed to any requirement classification, in the sense
of the requirement language.
