# Abstract {-}

Digital Rights Tokens represent the right, as issued by a *data provider*, to
execute an authorized, transparent computation on a given data set.  The latter
is assumed only be known up to its structure while individual data points are
never exposed to either the *data consumer* or the platform on which the
computation itself is performed.  The reference implementation utilizes the
[Intel SGX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html)
technology.
